ITERATION 0 REFERENCE
==================================================
Jan 28, 2026 - Gabriella (Revised by Team)
Completed ITR0 planning document
Defined initial user stories
Drafted preliminary architecture
Selected major story for ITR1

Time Spent: 2 hours

CUSTOMER MEETING
==================================================
Feb 4, 2026 - Gabriella/Tessa (Revised by Team)
Met with customer
Clarified scope of Iteration 1
Confirmed ITR1 requirements:
Domain objects
Stub database
Unit tests
GUI for one major story

Improvements requested:
Improve presentation and documentation template
Add group selection feature
Reduce focus on email functionality

Time Spent: 1 ½ hour

GROUP MEETING
==================================================
Feb 10, 2026 - Team
Divide user stories/ITR1 tasks

Time Spent: 15 minutes
REPOSITORY SETUP
==================================================
Feb 10, 2026
Created repository using GitHub Classroom
Cloned repository locally
Verified project builds on fresh clone
Time Spent: 10 minutes

PROJECT STRUCTURE SETUP
==================================================
Feb 12 - 13, 2026 - Monabbir (Log and uploading document Gabriella)
Tasks Completed:
Created initial project folder structure
Added README.md
Added log.md
Uploaded planning documents
Configured .gitignore
Cleaned repository:
Removed unused directories
Deleted accidental system files (.DS_Store)
Reorganized files for consistent structure
Established Git workflow:
Pull before starting work
Smaller and more frequent commits from the start
Descriptive/summary of commit messages

During early development, the team identified inconsistencies in how project files were cloned, pulled, and uploaded to GitHub. To resolve this, the repository structure was reorganized to ensure all team members used a consistent workflow and file structure.
Design Rationale:
Standardizing repository structure and Git practices improved collaboration, reduced version conflicts, and ensured consistent development across different environments.

 Estimated Time: 2 hours
 Actual Time: 2 hours

DOMAIN LAYER IMPLEMENTATION
==================================================
Feb 12–13, 2026
Implemented:
User domain model
Authentication-related classes
Input validation for login and registration
Ensured:
Proper constructors
Encapsulation
Clean naming conventions

 Estimated Time: 2 hours
 Actual Time: 2 ½  hours

DATABASE LAYER (STUB IMPLEMENTATION)
==================================================
Feb 13, 2026
Implemented:
User repository interface
H2 in-memory database configuration
Non-persistent data storage
Characteristics:
In-memory storage only
Prepares system for future database replacement
Supports authentication testing

Estimated Time: 2 hours
 Actual Time: 2 ½  hours
Design Rationale:
Using an in-memory database will allow rapid testing and supports future integration of persistent storage without changing business logic.

BUSINESS LOGIC LAYER
==================================================
Feb 13, 2026
Implemented:
User registration functionality
Login authentication logic
Role-based user handling (student/professor views)
Responsibilities:
Validating user credentials
Managing authentication flow
Connecting controllers with repository

Estimated Time: 2 hours
 Actual Time: 2 hours

UNIT TESTING
==================================================
Feb 13, 2026 - Tessa
Framework: JUnit 5
Current Coverage:
Basic application test configured for user stories, edge cases
Make sure all tests pass
Notes:
Full unit testing deferred
Focus of ITR1 was functional system implementation

Estimated Time: 1 hour
 Actual Time: 2 hour

GUI IMPLEMENTATION (FOR USER STORIES)
==================================================
Feb 13, 2026
Implemented:
Landing page interface
register/login, and the home page
Styling:
Tailwind CSS integration
Improved layout and navigation
Added features and FAQ sections
Notes:
GUI intentionally simple for ITR1
Additional styling planned for ITR2

Estimated Time: 3 hours
 Actual Time: 3 hours

DOCUMENTATION
==================================================
Feb 13, 2026 - Gabriella/Monabbir
Implemented:
Log.md completed
Wiki Github
Estimated Time: 1 hour
 Actual Time: 1 hour

USER STORY DEVELOPMENT SUMMARY
==================================================
User Story 1 — Create and Store Student Questions
Created question data model
Implemented in-memory storage (repository)
Connected GUI input to backend
User Story 2 — Instructor Replies to Questions
Instructor data placeholder
User Story 3 — Instructor View Questions (GUI)
Built basic instructor interface
Connected GUI to repository data
User Story 4 — Enter and Save Responses (GUI)
Created response input form
Connected form to backend logic
Implemented response saving
User Story 5 — Data Storage System
Implemented repository interface
Prepared system for future database integration

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ORGANIZATION
==================================================
Feb 13, 2026 - Gabriella
The system follows a layered architecture separating:
Domain Model (User and authentication classes)
Data Access Layer (repository and database configuration)
Business Logic Layer (authentication processing)
GUI Layer (controllers and templates)

Estimated Time: 20 minutes
 Actual Time: 20 minutes


PLAN CHANGES FROM ITR0
==================================================
Original Plan:
Full academic domain model (students, courses, registrations)
Advanced GUI
Extensive unit testing
Revised Plan:
Authentication-focused functionality
Basic GUI implementation
Stub database support
Reason:
 Scope adjusted to ensure a working system within the iteration timeframe.

MEETINGS
==================================================
Feb 10 – Architecture Discussion
Finalized layered architecture
Assigned development tasks
 Duration: 1 hour
